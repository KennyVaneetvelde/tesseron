# @tesseron/vite

## 2.1.1

### Patch Changes

- [#49](https://github.com/BrainBlend-AI/tesseron/pull/49) [`db6e0c4`](https://github.com/BrainBlend-AI/tesseron/commit/db6e0c4d1a83583c7012634c17d3579bc95060b7) Thanks [@KennyVaneetvelde](https://github.com/KennyVaneetvelde)! - Fix silent hangs when a transport send fails mid-request. Three places used to swallow `transport.send` failures with no signal: the gateway's session-dispatcher wrapper (bare `catch {}`), the SDK client's session-dispatcher wrapper (no try/catch at all), and the Vite plugin's gateway-to-browser bridge (silently dropped frames when `browserWs.readyState !== OPEN`). When a response failed to send, the peer's pending request would wait forever - the user-visible symptom was `tesseron__read_resource` hanging indefinitely after a Vite HMR cycle that left the browser WebSocket in a non-OPEN state.

  All three paths now close the channel on send failure so the peer's `transport.onClose` handler fires, `rejectAllPending` rejects every outstanding request with `TransportClosedError`, and the bridge / MCP tool surfaces a real error instead of hanging. Also reverts the 30s `DEFAULT_RESOURCE_READ_TIMEOUT_MS` band-aid added in [#47](https://github.com/BrainBlend-AI/tesseron/issues/47) - it would have papered over genuine hangs by silently failing legitimate slow reads, and the cascade-on-send-failure fix is what actually addresses the root cause.

  `JsonRpcDispatcher.receive()` no longer leaves `handleRequest` rejections as unhandled promise rejections - the transport wrappers now handle the recovery, so we attach an empty `.catch` to suppress noise.

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#37](https://github.com/BrainBlend-AI/tesseron/pull/37) [`f49f5bf`](https://github.com/BrainBlend-AI/tesseron/commit/f49f5bfcf11904b1c98a2b17c14ec89acbeb824a) Thanks [@KennyVaneetvelde](https://github.com/KennyVaneetvelde)! - Multi-binding transport layer (PROTOCOL_VERSION → 1.1.0). Decouples the
  protocol from WebSocket so apps that can host other duplex channels — Unix
  domain sockets, future named pipes / stdio — speak Tesseron without bridging
  through a WS server.

  Closes [#28](https://github.com/BrainBlend-AI/tesseron/issues/28), [#29](https://github.com/BrainBlend-AI/tesseron/issues/29), [#30](https://github.com/BrainBlend-AI/tesseron/issues/30), [#31](https://github.com/BrainBlend-AI/tesseron/issues/31), [#32](https://github.com/BrainBlend-AI/tesseron/issues/32), [#33](https://github.com/BrainBlend-AI/tesseron/issues/33), [#34](https://github.com/BrainBlend-AI/tesseron/issues/34).

  ### Protocol
  - New on-disk discovery format: `~/.tesseron/instances/<instanceId>.json`,
    v2 manifest with a discriminated `transport: { kind, ... }` field.
  - New types in `@tesseron/core`: `TransportSpec`, `InstanceManifest`.
  - `PROTOCOL_VERSION` bumped 1.0.0 → 1.1.0. Hard reject on major mismatch,
    warn on minor (covered by `protocol-version.test.ts`).
  - Compat: gateway reads both `instances/` (v2) and `tabs/` (v1) for one
    minor version. v1 manifests are coerced to `{ kind: 'ws', url }`. The
    legacy directory drops in 2.0.

  ### Bindings
  - **WebSocket** (default, unchanged on the wire) — formal binding spec at
    `/protocol/transport-bindings/ws/`.
  - **Unix domain socket** (new) — NDJSON framing on AF_UNIX sockets; SDK-side
    `UnixSocketServerTransport` in `@tesseron/server` (Linux + macOS).
    Same-UID enforcement via 0700 parent dir + 0600 socket file. Select with
    `tesseron.connect({ transport: 'uds' })`. Windows tracked separately —
    Node's `net.listen({ path })` binds named pipes there, which need a
    different binding.

  ### Gateway
  - `TesseronGateway.connectToApp(instanceId, spec: TransportSpec)` —
    signature change from `(tabId, wsUrl)`. Picks a dialer (`WsDialer`,
    `UdsDialer`) by `spec.kind`. Custom dialers can be registered via
    `new TesseronGateway({ dialers: [...] })`.
  - `TesseronGateway.watchInstances()` — replaces `watchAppsJson()`, which
    stays as a deprecated alias for one minor.
  - Internal `Session.ws: WebSocket` → `Session.transport: Transport`. Session
    shutdown now goes through the binding-neutral `transport.close(reason)`
    instead of a raw `ws.close(1001)` — UDS sessions don't have close codes.

  ### Vite plugin
  - `@tesseron/vite` writes v2 instance manifests (`{ kind: 'ws', url }`)
    instead of v1 tab files.
  - Internal `tabId` → `instanceId` (manifests are still per-tab; the rename
    drops the WS-only bias).

  ### Docs
  - `protocol/transport.md` rewritten as a binding-neutral overview.
  - New per-binding pages: `protocol/transport-bindings/ws.md`,
    `protocol/transport-bindings/uds.md`.
  - `sdk/porting.md` updated to describe how to write a new binding.
  - Cross-references in `handshake.mdx`, `wire-format.mdx`, `security.mdx`,
    `mcp.md`, `server.md`, `vite.md`, `quickstart.mdx`, `architecture.mdx`,
    `core.md`, `index.mdx` synced.

### Patch Changes

- [#35](https://github.com/BrainBlend-AI/tesseron/pull/35) [`7223ecc`](https://github.com/BrainBlend-AI/tesseron/commit/7223ecc2fa14ee92679847a9fd7649e6de444c3e) Thanks [@KennyVaneetvelde](https://github.com/KennyVaneetvelde)! - Fix `@tesseron/vite` forwarding text frames as binary frames so the browser
  SDK silently dropped every gateway message and the connection hung at
  `status: 'connecting'`.

  The `ws` library hands handlers a `Buffer` for both text and binary frames
  and `Buffer` arguments to `send()` are forwarded as binary, which the
  browser receives as a `Blob`. `BrowserWebSocketTransport` in `@tesseron/web`
  only handles `string` frames, so the `tesseron/welcome`, action results,
  progress, and every other gateway message were discarded.

  The bridge now reads the `isBinary` flag both directions, decodes text
  frames back to UTF-8 strings before re-emitting them, and queues frames in
  their original form so re-`send()` after the gateway connects produces the
  correct frame type.

  Fixes [#27](https://github.com/BrainBlend-AI/tesseron/issues/27).

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#21](https://github.com/BrainBlend-AI/tesseron/pull/21) [`21ce314`](https://github.com/BrainBlend-AI/tesseron/commit/21ce31470232bbdfad3843ed0399ce850302e7a4) Thanks [@KennyVaneetvelde](https://github.com/KennyVaneetvelde)! - Reversed connection architecture. The gateway is now a pure WebSocket client; apps host their own endpoints and announce themselves via `~/.tesseron/tabs/<tabId>.json`. One discovery mechanism for every runtime, no fixed ports.

  Breaking changes:
  - **`@tesseron/mcp`**: removed `gateway.start()`, `GatewayOptions.port` / `host` / `originAllowlist`, `DEFAULT_GATEWAY_PORT`, `DEFAULT_GATEWAY_HOST`, and the `TESSERON_PORT` / `TESSERON_HOST` / `TESSERON_ORIGIN_ALLOWLIST` environment variables. The CLI now watches `~/.tesseron/tabs/` exclusively.
  - **`@tesseron/server`**: `NodeWebSocketTransport` (a WS client) replaced with `NodeWebSocketServerTransport` (a WS server that binds loopback and writes a tab file). `DEFAULT_GATEWAY_URL` removed. `tesseron.connect()` no longer accepts a gateway URL string; pass `NodeWebSocketServerTransportOptions` (`appName`, `host`, `port`) or a custom `Transport`.
  - **`@tesseron/web`**: `DEFAULT_GATEWAY_URL` now derives from `location.origin` and points at `/@tesseron/ws` (served by the new `@tesseron/vite` plugin). Production-browser SPAs that previously dialed `ws://localhost:7475` must provide their own bridge.

  New packages:
  - **`@tesseron/vite`**: Vite plugin that exposes `/@tesseron/ws` on the dev server and bridges browser tabs to the gateway.
  - **`@tesseron/svelte`** and **`@tesseron/vue`**: framework adapters with lifecycle-scoped `tesseronAction` / `tesseronResource` / `tesseronConnection`.

  Required migration:
  - Browser apps: add `@tesseron/vite` to `devDependencies` and register `tesseron()` in `vite.config.ts`.
  - Node apps: no env vars or URLs to configure; `tesseron.connect()` handles bind-and-announce automatically.
